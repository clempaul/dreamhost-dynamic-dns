Dreamhost Dynamic DNS Script
============================

A Dynamic DNS updater for use with the Dreamhost API

- - -

This script updates a DNS A record hosted by Dreamhost to your current IP
address via the Dreamhost API.

You need to have generated an API key from the [web panel][panel] with
permissions for the following requests:

- dns-list_records
- dns-remove_record
- dns-add_record

_WARNING: Do not rely on this script to always work perfectly!!
Due to the lack of update\_record API request, we are forced to delete and 
then re-add. If there is a problem with the API, we could end up deleting
a record and then fail to re-add it. If you have this in cron, it will 
likely update the next time the script is run, or you could just be left 
without a DNS record at all._

This script is dependant on the following executables:
`bash` (this is a bash script after all), `wget` or `curl`, `uuidgen`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `dig`.

Usage
-----

The script can be run using either command line options or a configuration file.  A sample configuration file is found below.

__SYNOPSIS__

__dynamicdns.bash__ \[-Sd\]\[-k API Key\] \[-r Record\] \[-i New IP Address\] \[-L Logging (true/false)\]

__DESCRIPTION__
  
The __dynamicdns.bash__ utility reads a configuration file or command-line options to update DNS records for a Dreamhost account.  Options provided at the command line override any options specified within the configuration file.
  
The options are as follows:
  
>__-S__	Save any options provided via the command line to the configuration file.
  
>__-d__	Save any options provided via the command line to the configuration file and do not update DNS.

>__-v__ Enable verbose mode. 

>__-l__ Enable list-only mode, showing only current value returned by the Dreamhost API. 

>__-k__ *API Key*
>> Dreamhost API Key with dns-list\_records, dns-remove\_record, and dns-add\_record permissions.

>__-r__ *Record*
>> The DNS Record to be updated.

>__i__ *IP Address*
>> Specify the IPv4 Address to update the Record to.  If no address is specified, the utility will use __dig__ to obtain the current public IPv4 Address of your computer.

>__L__ *(true/false)*
>> Enables system logging via the __logger__ command.  The configuration file sets logging to *true* by default.

__RUNNING WITH CRON__

You can easily add this to your crontab with an entry like

 	@hourly ~/bin/dreamhost-dynamic-dns/dynamicdns.bash

TODO
----
- Allow disabling of error logging
- Add verbose mode
